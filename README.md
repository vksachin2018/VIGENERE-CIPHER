# Caeser Cipher
Caeser Cipher using with different key values

# AIM:
To encrypt and decrypt the given message by using Ceaser Cipher encryption algorithm.

## DESIGN STEPS:

### Step 1:

Design of Caeser Cipher algorithnm 

### Step 2:

Implementation using C or pyhton code

### Step 3:

1.	In Ceaser Cipher each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
2.	For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.
3.	The encryption can also be represented using modular arithmetic by first transforming the letters into numbers, according to the   
    scheme, A = 0, B = 1, Z = 25.
4.	Encryption of a letter x by a shift n can be described mathematically as,
                       En(x) = (x + n) mod26
5.	Decryption is performed similarly,
                       Dn (x)=(x - n) mod26


## PROGRAM:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <ctype.h>
void main()
{
 char plain[10], cipher[10];
 int key,i,length;
 int result;
 printf("\n Enter the plain text:");
 scanf("%s", plain);
 printf("\n Enter the key value:");
 scanf("%d", &key);
 printf("\n \n \t PLAIN TEXt: %s",plain);
 printf("\n \n \t ENCRYPTED TEXT: ");
 for(i = 0, length = strlen(plain); i < length; i++)
 {
 cipher[i]=plain[i] + key;
if (isupper(plain[i]) && (cipher[i] > 'Z'))
 cipher[i] = cipher[i] - 26;
 if (islower(plain[i]) && (cipher[i] > 'z'))
 cipher[i] = cipher[i] - 26;
 printf("%c", cipher[i]);
 }
 printf("\n \n \t AFTER DECRYPTION : ");
 for(i=0;i<length;i++)
 {
 plain[i]=cipher[i]-key;
 if(isupper(cipher[i])&&(plain[i]<'A'))
 plain[i]=plain[i]+26;
 if(islower(cipher[i])&&(plain[i]<'a'))
 plain[i]=plain[i]+26;
 printf("%c",plain[i]);
 }
}
```
